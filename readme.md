# React tic-tac-toe

A simple React Tic-tac-toe

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.

## Running Tests
The main focus of the unit tests was to ensure that the A.I. worked as required,
that it played perfectly, never lost, and that its individual heuristics behaved as expected.
The U.I. unit tests are limited to ensuring that the Board component is built and rendered properly.
Run `npm test` to run all unit tests
