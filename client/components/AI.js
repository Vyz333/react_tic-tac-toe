/**
Tic-tac-toe strategy based on : Kevin Crowley, Robert S. Siegler (1993).
"Flexible Strategy Use in Young Children's Tic-Tac-Toe". Cognitive Science. 17 (4): 531â€“561. doi:10.1016/0364-0213(93)90003-Q.

1.Win: If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.
2.Block: If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.
3.Fork: Create an opportunity where the player has two threats to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).
4.Blocking an opponent's fork:
 Option 1: The player should create two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as it doesn't result in them creating a fork.
 For example,
 if "X" has a corner, "O" has the center, and "X" has the opposite corner as well, "O" must not play a corner in order to win.
 (Playing a corner in this scenario creates a fork for "X" to win.)
 Option 2: If there is a configuration where the opponent can fork, the player should block that fork.
5.Center: A player marks the center.
(If it is the first move of the game, playing on a corner gives "O" more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice;
however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)
6.Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.
7.Empty corner: The player plays in a corner square.
8.Empty side: The player plays in a middle square on any of the 4 sides.
